# Title: Google Map API

## What is this?
I build a custom styled Google map with multiple custom markers using Google Map API and JavaScript.

## What is an API & Why is it important?
API stands for Application Programming Interface, a software-to-software interface that enables two applications to exchange data among each other. APIs can be a service for developers. Every time developers write a new program, they donâ€™t have to start from scratch to build a core application that tries to do everything. Instead, they can contract out certain responsibilities by using already created pieces that do the job better.
